"""Textual CSS themes for tfbrowser."""

# This directory would typically contain .tcss files.
# Python __init__.py might be used if themes are programmatically managed
# or to make it a package, but often it's just for .tcss files.

# For example, you might have:
# default_theme.tcss
# light_theme.tcss

# No specific Python exports are usually needed here unless loading themes via Python.
