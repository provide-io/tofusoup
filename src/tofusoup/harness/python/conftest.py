    # and this fixture could provide a conventional name or path if tests needed to refer to it
    # beyond what the test logic already handles.

    # For tests that need to *start* the Go server with specific crypto,
    # this fixture might need to be more complex, or the test logic itself
    # would handle calling `ensure_go_harness_build` and then running the binary with args.

        # The `go-harnesses/rpc/kvstore/` (used by soup generate-harness) also has a server.
        # Let's assume `generate-harness kvstore-go` produces `kvstore-server-go` in a general bin.

        # The ensure_go_harness_build should return the path to the directory containing the binary.
        # The actual name of the binary needs to be known.
        # `soup rpc kv server-start` assumes `kvstore-server-go` in `harness_path / "bin" / "kvstore-server-go"`
        # Let's assume `ensure_go_harness_build` returns the root of the harness build (e.g. .../tofusoup/harness/go/bin/go-rpc )
        # and the binary is at a known relative path like `bin/kvstore-server-go` or the name from GO_HARNESS_CONFIG.

        # For simplicity, this fixture will just return the directory provided by ensure_go_harness_build.
        # The test will then construct the full path to the executable.
        # A more robust fixture would return the full executable path.

        # Let's refine: assume `ensure_go_harness_build` returns the specific binary path directly.
        # This requires `harness.logic.ensure_go_harness_build` to be updated or to have a helper.
        # For now, let's assume it returns the directory, and we append the known name.
        # This needs to align with `soup rpc kv server-start` logic.
        # It uses: harness_path / "bin" / "kvstore-server-go"
        # where harness_path is from ensure_go_harness_build("kvstore-go", project_root)
        # So, ensure_go_harness_build must return the root of the specific harness deployment.

        # The `ensure_go_harness_build` in `tofusoup.harness.logic` is responsible for building
        # AND returning the path to the executable (or a directory from which it can be found).
        # The key "kvstore-go" must be defined in `GO_HARNESS_CONFIG` within `harness.logic.py`.

        # This fixture will ensure it's built and return the path to the executable.
        # The current `ensure_go_harness_build` in the plan returns the harness *root* dir.
        # Let's assume the build process places the binary at a known relative path from that root.
        # Or, `ensure_go_harness_build` should be enhanced to return the direct executable path.

        # For now, let this fixture just ensure it's built. The test logic will get the path.
        # This is consistent with how `run_test_suite` calls `ensure_go_harness_build`.
        # The test itself will then need to know the path to the executable.
        # This fixture is mainly for explicit invocation in tests if needed outside `run_test_suite`.

        # A simpler fixture: just provides the *name* of the harness key.
        # The test or test runner logic (`run_test_suite`) handles the building.
        # This avoids this conftest.py needing to know too much about build outputs.
        # return "kvstore-go" # The key for GO_HARNESS_CONFIG

        # Revised: Fixture should ensure build and provide path to the executable.
        # `ensure_go_harness_build` is expected to return the path to the directory
        # where binaries are placed, or directly to the binary.
