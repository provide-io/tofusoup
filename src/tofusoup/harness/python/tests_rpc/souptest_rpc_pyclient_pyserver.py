    # Assuming tofusoup is installed and in path, or use sys.executable
    # We need to ensure the server runs in the background and we can get its port/endpoint.
    # The current tofusoup.rpc.server.start_kv_server() is a blocking call.
    # For testing, it might need to be adapted or run via `soup rpc kv server-start --py`
    # and its process managed.

    # This is a simplified placeholder. Real implementation needs robust process management
    # and a way to know when the server is ready (e.g., specific log output or health check).
    # The current `start_kv_server` blocks, so it's not directly usable in a fixture background.
    # We'll assume for now that `soup rpc kv server-start --py` can be run.
    # The `pyvider-rpcplugin` uses environment variables for communication, not a fixed port for TCP.
    # It typically uses named pipes or UDS on Unix.

    # For this placeholder, we'll just note that a server needs to be running.
    # In a real scenario, we'd start `soup rpc kv server-start --py`
    # and manage its lifecycle.
    # For now, this fixture doesn't actually start a server, tests will need a live one
    # or this needs to be implemented properly.

    # Let's try to run it as a subprocess.
    # This requires finding the tofusoup executable or using python -m tofusoup.cli

    # Using a temporary directory for KV store data, if server uses relative paths or specific tmp locations.
    # The current server uses /tmp/kv-data-*

    # Need to capture server output to know when it's ready, or wait a fixed time.
    # Also need to manage PLUGIN_HOST_ADDRESS for the client if the server outputs it.
    # pyvider-rpcplugin server usually prints "plugin address" to stdout.

    try:
        # Start the server process
        # Redirect stdout to capture the plugin address
        # Set a unique PLUGIN_SERVER_PATH for this server instance for the client to pick up.
        # This is complex because the client also tries to start the server if not using a fixed path.
        # For PyClient vs PyServer, they would typically run in the same process for test simplicity
        # or the test would orchestrate two separate processes.

        # Let's assume for this test, the server is started MANUALLY or by a higher-level test runner.
        # This test will try to connect to a server whose details are passed via env.
        # This fixture will be a NO-OP for now, highlighting the need for external server setup
        # or a more sophisticated fixture.
        # logger.warning("Python KV server fixture is a placeholder and does not start a server automatically.")
        # For now, these tests will likely fail unless a server is running.
        # A better approach for testing PyClient vs PyServer would be in-process if possible,
        # or a test harness that launches the server via `soup rpc kv server-start --py`
        # and then launches the client actions.

        # For the purpose of this file creation, let's assume a very basic subprocess management
        # that might not be robust enough for actual CI.
        # The server writes to /tmp, so no special data dir needed for this basic test.
        # The client connects using a path to the server executable, which is not what we're testing here.
        # This test is PyClient vs PyServer.

        # The `tofusoup.rpc.server.start_kv_server()` is an async function that blocks.
        # We need to run it in a separate process for the client to connect.
        # This is more of an integration test.

        # This fixture needs to be more advanced, likely using `multiprocessing` or `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`
        # and managing the server lifecycle.
        # For now, we'll skip automatic server startup in this fixture.
        # The tests will assume the server is started by some other means if these are run directly.
        # Or, these tests would be integration tests run by `soup test rpc`.

        # This placeholder is insufficient. Actual RPC tests will require proper server lifecycle management.

# This client also needs a server path. For Py-Py tests, this is tricky.
# If the server is run as a plugin by pyvider-rpcplugin, it's via a path to a script.
# For now, let's assume the client will connect to a server started by `soup rpc kv server-start --py`
# and the address is somehow known (e.g. fixed if not using go-plugin style dynamic addressing).
# The current `KVClient` requires a `server_path` to an executable, which is not how Py-Py usually works
# unless the Python server is also launched as a "plugin" executable by the client.

# The `tofusoup.rpc.cli.kv_server_start_command` when using `--py` directly calls `python_start_kv_server()`.
# This server uses `pyvider.rpcplugin.server.RPCPluginServer`.
# The `pyvider.rpcplugin.client.RPCPluginClient` expects a command to run for the server.

# This suggests that for PyClient vs PyServer tests using this framework,
# the Python server itself should be packaged or invoked as an executable script.
# Let `tofusoup/src/tofusoup/rpc/server.py` be that script.
# The client will then be configured with the path to this script.
