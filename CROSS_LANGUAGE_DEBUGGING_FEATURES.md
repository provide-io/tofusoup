## Proposed `soup rpc` Structure

```
soup rpc
└── kv
    ├── get <key>
    ├── put <key> <value>
    ├── server
    └── validate
        └── connection
```

### Other Potential `soup rpc` Subcommands

Beyond `kv`, the `rpc` command could be extended to support other cross-language services:

*   **`soup rpc hcl-parser`**: An RPC service that provides HCL parsing, allowing clients in one language to leverage a canonical HCL parser written in another (e.g., using the Go parser from Python).
*   **`soup rpc type-checker`**: A service for validating data against a CTY type definition, offloading validation logic to a central, trusted implementation.
*   **`soup rpc state-reader`**: A service to securely read and parse Terraform state files, useful for tools inspecting infrastructure state without bundling full Terraform/OpenTofu logic.

### Nested Validation Tools

The `validate` subcommand is designed for extensibility and could house various validation tools in the future:

*   **`soup rpc kv validate payload <json-file> --type <cty-type>`**: Validates a JSON payload against a CTY type definition using the RPC service.
*   **`soup rpc kv validate handshake`**: A tool to specifically test the TLS handshake process between a client and server, without sending any application data.
*   **`soup rpc kv validate auth`**: For testing different authentication and authorization schemes for the RPC services.

## Features for Cross-Language Debugging

Here is a list of features that would significantly improve cross-language debugging within the `tofusoup` ecosystem:

1.  **RPC Message Inspector:**
    *   **What it is:** A tool that acts as a proxy between the client and server to capture, inspect, and even modify gRPC messages.
    *   **How it helps:** It would allow you to see the raw bytes being sent over the wire, helping to debug subtle serialization differences between the Python and Go implementations. You could also save a problematic message and "replay" it against the server to reproduce a bug.

2.  **CTY/HCL Equivalence Verifier:**
    *   **What it is:** A command that takes a CTY or HCL value and compares its canonical representation across both the Python and Go runtimes.
    *   **How it helps:** For example, `soup cty verify-equivalence '{"foo": 1}'`. This would show you the internal `cty.Value` representation in both Go and Python, highlighting any discrepancies in type inference, number precision, or object attribute ordering.

3.  **Wire Protocol Fuzzer:**
    *   **What it is:** A property-based testing tool that generates a stream of random, malformed, or unexpected wire protocol messages and sends them to a client or server.
    *   **How it helps:** This is excellent for finding security vulnerabilities, parsing errors, and crashes caused by unexpected input that might not be covered by standard tests.

4.  **Interactive RPC REPL:**
    *   **What it is:** An interactive command-line shell where you can manually craft and send gRPC requests to a running server.
    *   **How it helps:** It would provide a "hands-on" way to probe the server's behavior, test edge cases, and experiment with different inputs without having to write a full test script. For example: `(kv-repl) > put --key "my-key" --value "hello"`.

5.  **Distributed Tracing Integration:**
    *   **What it is:** Integrating OpenTelemetry into both the Python and Go components to generate and propagate trace information.
    *   **How it helps:** This would allow you to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request as it flows from the Python client, through the `go-plugin` machinery, to the Go server, and back. You could see the timing of each step and pinpoint exactly where an error or delay occurs.

6.  **TLS Handshake Debugger:**
    *   **What it is:** A tool that simulates a TLS handshake and prints out the details of each step, including the protocols being negotiated, the ciphers being used, and the certificates being exchanged.
    *   **How it helps:** This would be invaluable for debugging the mTLS issues that often arise in `go-plugin` setups, especially when dealing with certificates generated by different language runtimes.

These features would transform `tofusoup` from a conformance testing suite into a comprehensive cross-language development and debugging platform for the OpenTofu ecosystem.
