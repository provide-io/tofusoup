# üç≤ TofuSoup Conformance Suite
=============================

TofuSoup is a comprehensive, cross-language conformance testing suite and utility toolkit for ensuring compatibility and correctness across various implementations of OpenTofu-related technologies, including CTY, HCL, RPC mechanisms, and the Terraform Wire Protocol (tfwire).

It provides:

-   **Python-driven test suites:** For validating Python implementations against canonical Go harnesses and other language implementations.
-   **Go test harnesses:** Reference implementations for CTY, tfwire, and example RPC services.
-   **A powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI):** For development, testing, data conversion, and interaction with test services.

## Core Philosophy
---------------

-   **Cross-Language Compatibility:** Ensure that data formats and protocol behaviors are consistent across Go, Python, Rust, and JavaScript in the OpenTofu ecosystem.
-   **Developer Experience (DX):** Provide intuitive tools and clear feedback to developers working on or with these core components. Uses the `rich` library for enhanced console output.
-   **Modularity & Extensibility:** Structure the suite and CLI in a way that's easy to understand, maintain, and extend with new tests or utilities.
-   **Test Harnesses:** Utilizes language-specific test harnesses (e.g., Go) managed via the `soup harness` commands.

## Installation and Setup
----------------------

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/opentofu/tofusoup.git # Assuming this is the future location
    cd tofusoup
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup:** This project uses `uv` for Python environment and package management.
    ```bash
    # Ensure uv is installed (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
    # e.g., curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Source the environment script (activates venv, installs dependencies)
    # (From the root of the 'tofusoup' monorepo)
    source env.sh
    ```
    The `env.sh` script will:
    -   Create/activate a Python virtual environment (e.g., in `.venv/`).
    -   Install `tofusoup` in editable mode along with its dependencies using `uv pip install -e .[dev]`.
    -   Install any sibling `pyvider-*` packages found in the parent directory in editable mode.

3.  **Verify Installation:** The `env.sh` script will output version information upon successful setup. You can also manually check:
    ```bash
    uv --version
    python3 --version
    soup --version
    ```

**Note on Go Harnesses:** The Go test harnesses (`go-cty`, `go-wire`, `go-rpc`, `go-hcl`) are standardized to use `cobra` for their CLI structure and `go-hclog` for logging. This provides a consistent interface and configurable logging (via a `--log-level` flag) across these tools.

**Note on Test Artifacts:** Output from CLI verification tests (stdout, stderr of harness executions) is saved to `tofusoup/soup/output/cli_verification/<harness_name>/<test_id>/` for inspection. Other build or test artifacts may also be placed under `tofusoup/soup/output/`.

## `tofusoup` Command-Line Interface (CLI)
---------------------------------------

The `tofusoup` CLI is your primary interface for interacting with the suite. It's organized into subcommands based on the component you're working with. All commands provide enhanced terminal output using the `rich` library.

**General Options (available for `tofusoup` and all subcommands):**
-   `--help`: Show help for the current command or subcommand.
-   `--verbose`: Enable verbose output (shortcut for --log-level DEBUG).
-   `--log-level <LEVEL>`: Set the logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO). Overrides `TOFUSOUP_LOG_LEVEL` env var and `soup.toml` settings. See `docs/CONFIG_TOML.md`.
-   `--config-file <PATH>`: Path to the TofuSoup configuration file (TOML format, default: `soup.toml`). Searched in order: explicit path, `./soup.toml`, `<project_root>/soup/soup.toml`. See `docs/CONFIG_TOML.md`.
-   `--version` (only for top-level `tofusoup`): Show TofuSoup version.

### üß± `soup cty` - CTY Utilities & Tests

Commands for working with the Configuration Type System (CTY).

-   **`soup cty view <filepath> [--format <json|msgpack|hcl>]`**
    -   Displays the CTY structure of a given JSON, Msgpack, or HCL data file. The format is inferred from the extension if not specified. For HCL, this command attempts to parse it as generic CTY-compatible HCL; for more direct HCL parsing and representation, use `soup hcl view`.
    -   Output is a rich tree view.
    -   Example: `soup cty view data.json`
    -   Example: `soup cty view data.mpk --format msgpack`
    -   Example: `soup cty view config.tfvars --format hcl` (with warning)

-   **`soup cty convert <input_file> <output_file> [--input-format <json|msgpack|hcl>] [--output-format <json|msgpack>]`**
    -   Converts files between CTY-compatible JSON, Msgpack, and HCL (input only for HCL).
    -   Formats are inferred from file extensions if options are not provided.
    -   Example: `soup cty convert input.json output.msgpack`
    -   Example: `soup cty convert config.tf output.json --input-format hcl`

-   **`soup cty test [compat|all]`**
    -   (Deprecated in favor of `soup test cty`). Runs older CTY test suites.
    -   `compat`: Executes Python vs. Go CTY compatibility tests. Requires `go-cty` harness.

-   **`soup cty benchmark [--iterations N] [--testcase <name>] [--data-file <path>] [--output-dir <path>]`**
    -   Runs CTY encoding/decoding benchmarks. Options can be defaulted in `soup.toml`.
    -   Requires `go-cty` harness. See `docs/CONFIG_TOML.md`.

-   **`soup cty validate-value <value_json_string> --type-string <cty_type_string> [--harness-path <path>]`**
    -   Validates a CTY value (JSON string) against a CTY type string using the `go-cty` harness.
    -   Type string example: "object({name=string,age=number})".
    -   The value must be a valid JSON representation of the data to be validated.
    -   Example: `soup cty validate-value '"hello"' --type-string string`
    -   Example: `soup cty validate-value '[1, 2, 3]' --type-string "list(number)"`
    -   Example: `soup cty validate-value '{"name":"opustofu","age":1}' --type-string "object({name=string,age=number})"`

### üìÑ `soup hcl` - HCL Utilities

Commands specifically for HCL file processing (often in conjunction with CTY).

-   **`soup hcl view <filepath>`**
    -   Parses an HCL file and displays its structure as a CTY representation using a rich tree view.

-   **`soup hcl convert <input_file> <output_file> [--output-format <json|msgpack>]`**
    -   Converts an HCL file to JSON or Msgpack. This implicitly uses CTY as the intermediate representation.
    -   Output format inferred if not specified.
    -   Example: `soup hcl convert network.hcl network.json`
    -   Default output format can be configured in `soup.toml`. See `docs/CONFIG_TOML.md`.

### üîå `soup rpc` - RPC Utilities & Tests

Commands for interacting with and testing RPC components, exemplified by a Key-Value store. Uses `pyvider-rpcplugin` for Python client logic.

-   **`soup rpc test [compat|all]`**
    -   (Deprecated in favor of `soup test rpc`). Runs older RPC test suites.
    -   Requires `go-rpc` harness.

### üîó `soup wire` - Terraform Wire Protocol Utilities & Tests

Commands for working with the Terraform Wire Protocol (tfwire) objects. These commands act as a CLI and testing interface for the canonical `pyvider.wire` Python library.

-   **`soup wire encode <input_json_file> <output_tfw_b64_file>`**
    -   Encodes a JSON representation of a Terraform object (which must include 'type' and 'value' keys) into the tfwire format (MessagePack, then Base64 encoded), utilizing `pyvider.wire`.
