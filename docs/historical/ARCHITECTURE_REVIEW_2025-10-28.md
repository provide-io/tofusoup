## 1. Project Architecture

### 1.1 Overall Structure

TofuSoup follows a **modular monolith** architecture with clear domain boundaries:

```
tofusoup/
├── src/tofusoup/           # Main Python source (10,919 LOC)
│   ├── cli.py              # Entry point with plugin detection (265 LOC)

└── tests/                  # Unit tests (21 files)
```

### 1.2 Key Architectural Patterns

#### **Lazy Loading Pattern (Performance Optimization)**
The CLI uses a custom `LazyGroup` class that defers module imports until command invocation:

```python
# src/tofusoup/common/lazy_group.py (49 LOC)
class LazyGroup(click.Group):
    """Loads commands lazily from import strings to prevent
    importing all dependencies at startup."""
```

This design achieves:
- Fast CLI startup time
- Reduced memory footprint
- Avoids side effects from unused modules
- Excellent for large CLI applications

**Analysis:** This is an excellent pattern for CLI performance, particularly important for developer tools that may be invoked frequently.

#### **Dual-Mode Entry Point (CLI + Plugin Server)**
The entry point (`cli.py`) intelligently detects whether it's being invoked as a CLI tool or as a go-plugin server:

```python
# src/tofusoup/cli.py:121-149
def entry_point():
    """CLI entry point with automatic plugin server detection."""
    magic_cookie_key = os.getenv("PLUGIN_MAGIC_COOKIE_KEY", "BASIC_PLUGIN")
    magic_cookie_value = os.getenv(magic_cookie_key)

    # Check if invoked as plugin server
    is_plugin_mode = magic_cookie_value and (
        len(sys.argv) == 1 or
        (len(sys.argv) == 3 and sys.argv[1] == "rpc" and sys.argv[2] == "server-start")
    )
```

**Analysis:** This dual-mode design is elegant and follows go-plugin conventions. However, the plugin detection logic is somewhat fragile and depends on specific argv patterns.

**Recommendation:** Consider using a more explicit environment variable (e.g., `TOFUSOUP_PLUGIN_MODE`) to avoid edge cases.

#### **Cross-Language Bridge Pattern**
TofuSoup implements a sophisticated bridge between Python and Go implementations:

**Python Side:**
- `pyvider-cty`, `pyvider-hcl`, `pyvider-rpcplugin` - Python implementations
- CLI tools for conversion, validation, viewing
- Conformance tests that validate behavior

**Go Side (soup-go harness):**
- Reference implementations for CTY, HCL, Wire, RPC
- cobra-based CLI matching Python CLI structure
- Used as "ground truth" for conformance testing

**Bridge Mechanism:**
- Go harnesses built via `ensure_go_harness_build()`
- Subprocess invocation for CLI operations
- gRPC for RPC communication
- Conformance tests compare outputs

**Analysis:** This bridge pattern is well-executed and enables true cross-language validation. The symmetry between Python and Go CLIs is particularly elegant.

### 1.3 Dependency Graph

```
Core Dependencies:
├── provide-foundation[all]     - Logging, telemetry, process management
├── click                       - CLI framework
├── rich                        - Terminal formatting
├── textual                     - TUI framework
├── msgpack                     - Binary serialization
├── httpx/respx                 - HTTP client and mocking
├── grpc                        - RPC communication

├── aiosqlite                   - Async database
├── semver                      - Version parsing
├── jinja2                      - Templating
└── pyvider ecosystem           - Core implementations
    ├── pyvider                 - Base package
    ├── pyvider-cty             - CTY implementation
    ├── pyvider-hcl             - HCL parser
    └── pyvider-rpcplugin       - RPC plugin infrastructure

Optional Dependencies:
├── wrknv                       - Matrix testing (workenv)
└── plating                     - Documentation generation

Development Dependencies:
└── provide-testkit[standard,advanced-testing,build]
```

**Analysis:** The dependency tree is well-organized with clear separation between core, optional, and development dependencies. The heavy reliance on the `provide` ecosystem (foundation, testkit) suggests tight coupling with that framework.

**Concern:** The comment in pyproject.toml mentions wrknv has dependency conflicts with plating (rich version). This suggests potential version pinning issues.

## 2. Core Components Analysis

### 2.1 CLI Implementation (src/tofusoup/cli.py)

**Structure:** 265 lines implementing:
- Lazy command loading
- Plugin server auto-detection
- Configuration management
- Foundation initialization

**Key Features:**
1. **Performance-Optimized Startup:**
   ```python
   LAZY_COMMANDS = {
       "sui": ("tofusoup.browser.cli", "sui_cli"),
       "registry": ("tofusoup.registry.cli", "registry_cli"),
       # ... 9 lazy-loaded commands
   }
   ```

2. **Intelligent Logging:**
   - CLI mode: Info level by default
   - Plugin mode: Error level (minimal logging)
   - Respects `TOFUSOUP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
   - Per-command override via `--log-level` flag

3. **Project Root Discovery:**
   - Walks up directory tree to find `pyproject.toml`
   - Falls back to current directory
   - Used for configuration file resolution

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Well-documented with clear comments
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ⚠️ Plugin detection logic at cli.py:128-149 could be more robust
- ⚠️ Debug logging to `/tmp/tofusoup_plugin_debug.log` is not configurable

**Recommendation:** Extract plugin server logic to a separate module for better testability and separation of concerns.

### 2.2 RPC System (src/tofusoup/rpc/)

**Files:** 6 modules totaling 1,849 LOC
- `server.py` (377 LOC) - Python KV gRPC server implementation
- `client.py` (504 LOC) - Python RPC client with mTLS support
- `cli.py` (300 LOC) - RPC CLI commands
- `validation.py` (181 LOC) - Compatibility matrix validation
- `logic.py` (163 LOC) - Core RPC logic
- `plugin_server.py` (88 LOC) - Plugin server wrapper

#### **Server Implementation (server.py)**

**Architecture:**
```python
class KV(kv_pb2_grpc.KVServicer):
    """Simple file-based key-value store."""

    def __init__(self, storage_dir: str = "/tmp"):
        self.storage_dir = storage_dir
        self.key_pattern = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$")

    def Get(self, request, context) -> GetResponse:
        """Retrieve value from file storage."""

    def Put(self, request, context) -> Empty:
        """Store value to file storage with enrichment."""
```

**Interesting Features:**

1. **JSON Enrichment (lines 45-114):**
   - Automatically detects JSON values
   - Adds server handshake metadata
   - Includes TLS config, certificate fingerprint, timestamp
   - Non-destructive (preserves non-JSON values)

   **Analysis:** This is clever for debugging but could be unexpected behavior. Consider making it opt-in via environment variable.

2. **Three TLS Modes:**
   - `disabled`: Insecure gRPC
   - `auto`: Self-signed certificates via `provide.foundation.crypto`
   - `manual`: User-provided certificates

3. **go-plugin Handshake Format:**
   ```python
   # Format: core_version|protocol_version|network|address|protocol|cert
   handshake_line = f"{core_version}|{protocol_version}|{network}|{address}|{protocol}|{cert_b64}"
   print(handshake_line, flush=True)
   ```

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Excellent logging with structured fields
- ✅ Proper error handling with gRPC status codes
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ⚠️ File-based storage is not concurrent-safe (no locking)
- ⚠️ Storage directory `/tmp` could be problematic in some environments
- ⚠️ No cleanup mechanism for old KV files

**Recommendation:** Consider using a proper embedded database (SQLite) instead of file-based storage, or at least implement file locking.

#### **Validation System (validation.py)**

Implements a **compatibility matrix** for client-server pairs:

```python
COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX = {
    "python": {
        "python": True,
        "go": False,  # secp521r1 curve not supported in Python
    },
    "go": {
        "python": True,
        "go": True,
    },
}
```

**Analysis:** This is excellent for user experience - prevents attempting incompatible configurations. However, the hardcoded matrix suggests limited flexibility for future expansion.

**Recommendation:** Consider moving the compatibility matrix to a configuration file for easier updates.

### 2.3 CTY/HCL/Wire Protocol Modules

These modules are thin wrappers around `pyvider` implementations:

**CTY (325 LOC):**
- `view`: Display CTY structure as JSON
- `convert`: Convert between JSON/MessagePack formats
- `validate-value`: Validate value against type specification

**HCL (307 LOC):**
- `view`: Parse and display HCL as CTY
- `convert`: Convert HCL to JSON/MessagePack

**Wire (169 LOC):**
- `encode`: JSON → MessagePack → Base64
- `decode`: Base64 → MessagePack → JSON

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
CLI Command → Logic Module → Pyvider Library → Result → Rich Output
```

**Analysis:** This layered architecture is clean and maintainable. The CLI modules focus on presentation while delegating core logic to pyvider libraries. However, error messages could be improved - they often expose pyvider exceptions directly.

**Recommendation:** Add exception translation layer to convert pyvider exceptions to user-friendly messages.

### 2.4 Testing Infrastructure (src/tofusoup/testing/)

**Files:** 4 modules totaling 1,055 LOC
- `cli.py` (86 LOC) - Test execution CLI
- `logic.py` (190 LOC) - Test suite management
- `matrix.py` (419 LOC) - Matrix test execution
- `matrix_profiles.py` (360 LOC) - Test profiles and configurations

**Test Architecture:**
```
soup test <suite> → logic.run_test_suite() → pytest with custom args
                                           → Environment configuration
                                           → Skip/marker configuration
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Configurable Test Suites** (from soup.toml):
   ```python
   AVAILABLE_TEST_SUITES = {
       "cty": "conformance/cty/",
       "rpc": "conformance/rpc/",
       "wire": "conformance/wire/",
       # ... more suites
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Management:**
   - Harness paths
   - Log levels
   - TLS configuration
   - Storage directories

3. **Matrix Testing:**
   - Run tests across multiple Terraform/OpenTofu versions
   - Parallel execution
   - Result aggregation

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Well-structured with clear responsibilities
- ✅ Good integration with pytest
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration options
- ⚠️ Matrix testing implementation is complex (419 LOC)
- ⚠️ Heavy reliance on subprocess for test execution

**pytest Configuration Analysis:**

From `pyproject.toml`:
```python
addopts = [
    "-k", "not (TestRPCKVMatrix or test_pyclient_pyserver_with_mtls or test_stir)",
]
```

**⚠️ Critical Finding:** The default pytest configuration **excludes specific tests**, including:
- `TestRPCKVMatrix` - Matrix testing
- `test_pyclient_pyserver_with_mtls` - mTLS testing
- `test_stir` - Stir framework tests

This suggests these tests are **flaky or broken**. This is a significant code quality concern.

**Recommendation:** Investigate and fix the excluded tests or document why they're excluded.

### 2.5 Harness Management (src/tofusoup/harness/)

**Purpose:** Build and manage Go test harnesses

**Architecture:**
```python
GO_HARNESS_CONFIG = {
    "soup-go": {
        "source_dir": "src/tofusoup/harness/go/soup-go",
        "main_file": "main.go",
        "output_name": "soup-go",
    },
}

def ensure_go_harness_build(harness_name, project_root, loaded_config, force_rebuild):
    """Build Go harness if needed."""
```

**Build Process:**
1. Check if binary exists (skip if not force_rebuild)
2. Read configuration for build flags and environment
3. Execute `go build -o <output> <source>`
4. Handle errors (Go not found, build failures)

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Clean configuration-driven approach
- ✅ Good error handling
- ✅ Proper use of pathlib
- ⚠️ No build caching or dependency tracking
- ⚠️ No version checking for Go compiler
- ⚠️ Build output directory is hardcoded to `bin/`

**Recommendation:** Consider using `go.mod` checksums to detect when rebuild is actually needed.

### 2.6 Go Harness Implementation (soup-go)

**Structure:** 6 Go files totaling 2,291 LOC
- `main.go` (311 LOC) - CLI setup with cobra
- `cty.go` - CTY operations
- `hcl.go` - HCL operations
- `wire.go` - Wire protocol operations
- `rpc.go` - RPC server/client
- `rpc_shared.go` - Shared RPC utilities

**Architecture:**
```
soup-go (cobra CLI)
├── cty
│   ├── validate
│   └── convert
├── hcl
│   ├── view
│   ├── validate
│   └── convert
├── wire
│   ├── encode
│   └── decode
├── rpc
│   ├── kv
│   │   ├── get
│   │   ├── put
│   │   └── server
│   └── validate
│       └── connection
├── harness
│   ├── list
│   └── test
└── config
    └── show
```

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Clean cobra-based CLI structure
- ✅ Consistent command patterns
- ✅ Good use of go-hclog for logging
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Matches Python CLI structure for consistency

**Analysis:** The Go harness is well-designed and provides excellent parity with the Python implementation. The command structure is nearly identical, which is crucial for conformance testing.

---

## 3. Code Quality Assessment

### 3.1 Python Code Quality

**Strengths:**
1. **Modern Python (3.11+):**
   - Uses `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`
   - Union types with `|` operator
   - Proper use of type hints throughout

2. **Consistent Style:**
   - Ruff configuration enforces style
   - 111 character line length (reasonable for modern screens)
   - Consistent import ordering

3. **Type Safety:**
   - Mypy strict mode enabled
   - Comprehensive type hints
   - Type stubs for generated protobuf code

4. **Documentation:**
   - Apache 2.0 license headers on all files
   - SPDX identifiers for compliance
   - Module docstrings (though many are "TODO: Add module docstring")

**Weaknesses:**

1. **TODO Docstrings (Critical):**
   ```python
   """TODO: Add module docstring."""
   ```
   This appears in **multiple core modules** including:
   - `cli.py`
   - `common/__init__.py`
   - `cty/cli.py`
   - `rpc/cli.py`
   - `harness/logic.py`

   **Impact:** Significantly reduces code maintainability and onboarding experience.

   **Recommendation:** High-priority task to add proper module docstrings explaining purpose, key classes, and usage patterns.

2. **Mixed Async/Sync Patterns:**
   - Some modules use async (RPC client)
   - Others use sync (CLI commands)
   - Inconsistent use of `asyncio.run()` vs direct async calls

   **Recommendation:** Establish clear guidelines for when to use async vs sync.

3. **Error Handling Inconsistency:**
   - Some functions use exceptions
   - Others return None or False on failure
   - Not all exceptions are caught at CLI boundaries

   **Recommendation:** Implement consistent error handling strategy, possibly using Result types.

4. **Code Duplication:**
   - Certificate handling code appears in multiple places
   - File path resolution duplicated across modules
   - Similar CLI patterns repeated

   **Recommendation:** Extract common patterns to shared utilities.

### 3.2 Go Code Quality

**Strengths:**
1. Clean cobra-based CLI
2. Consistent error handling
3. Good use of standard library
4. Proper logging with go-hclog

**Weaknesses:**
1. Limited test coverage (no Go tests visible)
2. Some hardcoded values (port 50051)
3. TLS configuration could be more modular

### 3.3 Test Coverage

**Conformance Tests:** 55 files covering:
- CTY operations
- HCL parsing
- Wire protocol encoding/decoding
- RPC communication (Python ↔ Go)
- CLI verification

**Unit Tests:** 21 files covering:
- Utility functions
- Configuration loading
- Serialization

**pytest Configuration:**
- Comprehensive markers for test classification
- Parallel execution support (`-n auto`)
- Benchmark support
- Async test support

**⚠️ Critical Findings:**

1. **Excluded Tests in Default Configuration:**
   ```python
   "-k", "not (TestRPCKVMatrix or test_pyclient_pyserver_with_mtls or test_stir)"
   ```
   Tests are excluded by default, suggesting stability issues.

2. **No Visible Go Tests:**
   The Go harness has no test files, meaning the Go implementation is only tested via conformance tests from Python.

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix or remove excluded tests
2. Add Go unit tests for soup-go harness
3. Increase test coverage for error paths
4. Add integration tests for full workflows

---

## 4. Architecture Assessment

### 4.1 Design Patterns Used

| Pattern | Usage | Quality |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Lazy Loading** | CLI command loading | ✅ Excellent |
| **Factory** | Harness creation | ✅ Good |
| **Strategy** | TLS mode selection | ✅ Good |
| **Facade** | Pyvider library wrappers | ✅ Good |
| **Template Method** | Test suite execution | ✅ Good |
| **Observer** | Logging via foundation | ✅ Good |
| **Bridge** | Python-Go communication | ✅ Excellent |

### 4.2 SOLID Principles Analysis

**Single Responsibility:**
- ✅ Most modules have clear, focused responsibilities
- ⚠️ `cli.py` handles both CLI routing and plugin server detection

**Open/Closed:**
- ✅ New commands can be added without modifying core
- ✅ New harnesses via configuration
- ⚠️ Compatibility matrix is hardcoded

**Liskov Substitution:**
- ✅ Good use of protocol/interface patterns
- ✅ gRPC servicer inheritance properly used

**Interface Segregation:**
- ✅ Small, focused interfaces
- ✅ CLI commands are independently loadable

**Dependency Inversion:**
- ✅ Depends on abstractions (pyvider interfaces)
- ⚠️ Some tight coupling to provide-foundation

### 4.3 Modularity Assessment

**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- Clear module boundaries
- Minimal circular dependencies
- Good use of dependency injection
- Configuration-driven behavior

**Weaknesses:**
- Some cross-cutting concerns (logging, config) spread across modules
- Heavy reliance on provide ecosystem
- Limited plugin extensibility beyond RPC

---

## 5. Performance Analysis

### 5.1 CLI Startup Performance

**Optimization Techniques:**
1. **Lazy Command Loading:** Defers imports until needed
2. **Foundation Lazy Initialization:** Only initializes when first used
3. **Minimal Initial Imports:** Core CLI imports only Click and essential modules

**Measured Impact:**
- With lazy loading: Fast startup for `soup --help`
- Without lazy loading: Would load all 11,000 LOC of Python

**Analysis:** Excellent performance optimization for developer experience.

### 5.2 RPC Performance

**Server Architecture:**
- ThreadPoolExecutor with 10 workers
- File-based KV storage
- No caching layer

**Potential Bottlenecks:**
1. File I/O for every Get/Put operation
2. No connection pooling on client side
3. JSON enrichment on every Put (regex + parsing)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add optional in-memory cache for frequently accessed keys
2. Implement connection pooling in client
3. Make JSON enrichment opt-in

### 5.3 Test Execution Performance

**Current Approach:**
- Sequential test execution by default
- Parallel execution available via `pytest -n auto`
- Each conformance test may build Go harness

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Cache Go harness builds between test runs
2. Parallelize conformance test execution
3. Use pytest-xdist more effectively

---

## 6. Security Analysis

### 6.1 TLS Implementation

**Modes Supported:**
1. **Disabled:** Insecure gRPC (development only)
2. **Auto mTLS:** Self-signed certificates generated at runtime
3. **Manual:** User-provided certificates

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Multiple elliptic curves (P-256, P-384, P-521)
- ✅ RSA support (2048, 4096 bit)
- ✅ Certificate validation
- ✅ Client and server authentication

**Security Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Auto mode uses self-signed certificates (expected for go-plugin)
- ⚠️ No certificate revocation checking
- ⚠️ No certificate pinning
- ⚠️ Server certificate stored in `/tmp` (world-readable)

**Recommendation:** Add documentation clarifying that auto mode is for development/testing only.

### 6.2 Input Validation

**Key Validation (RPC):**
```python
self.key_pattern = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$")
```
- ✅ Prevents path traversal
- ✅ Prevents special characters
- ⚠️ No length limit on keys
- ⚠️ No rate limiting

**CTY/HCL Validation:**
- Delegated to pyvider libraries
- Exception-based error handling

**Recommendation:** Add key length limits and rate limiting to RPC server.

### 6.3 Dependency Security

**Foundation-Provided Security:**
- Uses `provide.foundation.crypto` for certificate generation
- Structured logging reduces information leakage
- Process management via foundation

**Concerns:**
- Heavy reliance on provide ecosystem (single point of failure)
- No visible dependency scanning in CI
- No SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

**Recommendation:** Add dependency scanning (e.g., pip-audit) to CI pipeline.

---

## 7. Maintainability Analysis

### 7.1 Code Organization

**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- Clear directory structure
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Consistent naming conventions
- Good separation of concerns

**Weaknesses:**
- Duplicate proto directories (`harness/proto/` and `harnesses/proto/`)
- Some configuration scattered across modules
- `TODO` docstrings throughout

### 7.2 Documentation Quality

**Score: 5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Excellent README.md with comprehensive CLI documentation
- CLAUDE.md provides good development context
- Inline comments explain complex logic
- SPDX license headers

**Weaknesses:**
- Many modules have "TODO: Add module docstring"
- No API documentation generated (Sphinx/mkdocs)
- No architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Limited inline documentation for complex algorithms

**Critical Recommendation:** Address TODO docstrings as highest priority.

### 7.3 Configuration Management

**Configuration Files:**
1. **pyproject.toml:** Python package, dependencies, tools
2. **soup.toml:** TofuSoup-specific configuration
3. **CLAUDE.md:** Development guidelines

**Configuration Loading:**
```python
def load_tofusoup_config(project_root, explicit_config_file=None):
    """Load configuration from soup.toml."""
```

**Strengths:**
- TOML format (human-readable)
- Hierarchical configuration
- Environment variable overrides
- Project root auto-discovery

**Weaknesses:**
- Configuration schema not validated
- No default configuration file generated
- Error messages for missing config could be clearer

---

## 8. Testing Strategy Assessment

### 8.1 Test Architecture

**Three-Layer Testing:**
```
1. Unit Tests (tests/) → Test Python utilities in isolation
2. Conformance Tests (conformance/) → Test Python vs Go implementations
3. CLI Verification Tests → Test CLI interfaces match specifications
```

**Test Fixtures (conftest.py):**
- `project_root`: Auto-discovered from pyproject.toml
- `loaded_tofusoup_config`: Loads soup.toml
- `go_harness_executable`: Builds and provides Go harnesses
- `tls_cert_paths_*`: Provides certificates for different curves

**Analysis:** This is an excellent testing architecture that validates both implementation correctness and cross-language compatibility.

### 8.2 Conformance Testing

**Test Categories:**
1. **CTY Tests:** Value validation, type checking, conversions
2. **HCL Tests:** Parsing, CTY conversion
3. **Wire Tests:** Encoding/decoding, binary compatibility
4. **RPC Tests:** Client-server communication, mTLS

**Testing Pattern:**
```python
@pytest.mark.integration_rpc
@pytest.mark.parametrize("go_harness_executable", ["soup-go"], indirect=True)
def test_python_client_go_server(go_harness_executable):
    """Test Python client connecting to Go server."""
```

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of cross-language scenarios
- Good use of pytest parametrization
- Proper test isolation

**Weaknesses:**
- Some tests excluded by default (flaky tests)
- Limited test data variety
- No property-based testing visible (Hypothesis imported but not used)

### 8.3 Test Quality

**pytest Configuration Analysis:**

```python
markers = [
    "conformance: marks tests as conformance tests",
    "integration_cty: requires CTY integration",
    "integration_hcl: requires HCL integration",
    "integration_rpc: requires RPC integration",
    "harness_go: requires Go harness",
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
]
```

**Analysis:** Excellent marker system for test organization. Allows selective test execution based on available dependencies.

**⚠️ Concern:** Default addopts exclude several tests:
```python
"-k", "not (TestRPCKVMatrix or test_pyclient_pyserver_with_mtls or test_stir)"
```

This is a red flag suggesting unstable tests.

## 9. Integration Points

### 9.1 Pyvider Ecosystem Integration

**Dependencies:**
- `pyvider` - Base package
- `pyvider-cty` - CTY implementation
- `pyvider-hcl` - HCL parser
- `pyvider-rpcplugin` - RPC plugin framework

**Integration Pattern:**
```python
# TofuSoup wraps pyvider functionality
from pyvider.cty import Value, Type, parse_tf_type_to_ctytype
from pyvider.hcl import parse_hcl
from pyvider.rpcplugin.server import RPCPluginServer
```

**Analysis:** TofuSoup acts as a **thin CLI layer** over pyvider implementations. This is good separation but creates tight coupling to pyvider's API stability.

**Recommendation:** Consider defining abstract interfaces in TofuSoup that pyvider implements, providing more flexibility for future changes.

### 9.2 go-plugin Integration

**Protocol Compliance:**
- ✅ Magic cookie validation
- ✅ Handshake protocol (core_version|protocol_version|network|address|protocol|cert)
- ✅ AutoMTLS support
- ✅ TCP and Unix socket transports

**Implementation Quality:**
- ✅ Follows go-plugin v2 protocol
- ✅ Proper certificate handling
- ⚠️ Limited error recovery
- ⚠️ Debug logging to `/tmp` not production-ready

### 9.3 Registry Integration

**Supported Registries:**
- Terraform Registry
- OpenTofu Registry

**Features:**
- Provider search and listing
- Module search and listing
- Version information
- Caching layer

**Code Quality:**
- 1,449 LOC across 8 modules
- Good separation between Terraform and OpenTofu clients
- Caching via aiosqlite
- Textual-based TUI (sui command)

**Analysis:** Well-designed registry integration with good caching strategy.
