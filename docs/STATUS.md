# TofuSoup Project Status Update

**Date:** August 7, 2025

## 1. Project Goal

The overarching goal of the `tofusoup` project is to provide a comprehensive, cross-language conformance testing suite and utility toolkit for ensuring compatibility and correctness across various implementations of OpenTofu-related technologies, including CTY, HCL, RPC mechanisms, and the Terraform Wire Protocol (tfwire). The `soup-go` executable is intended to be a polyglot harness, mirroring core functionalities of the Python `soup` CLI for CTY, HCL, RPC, and Wire, enabling cross-language interoperability testing.

## 2. Current State & Issues Encountered

Initial attempts to run `pytest` and `soup test all` within the `tofusoup` directory revealed several critical issues, primarily related to the Go harness (`soup-go`) build process and its CLI functionality.

**Key Issues Identified:**

*   **Go Harness Build Failures (`soup-go`):**
    *   `protoc-gen-go: program not found`: This error persistently occurred during the `go generate` step, indicating that the `protoc` plugins (`protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc`) were not found in the `PATH` environment variable when the `go generate` subprocess was invoked.
    *   `package tofusoup/harness/go/soup-go/proto is not in std`: This error, appearing during `go build`, suggests that the Go compiler is failing to recognize the locally generated `proto` package as part of the `soup-go` module, instead looking for it in the standard library. This is a fundamental module resolution problem.
    *   `go.mod` dependency conflicts: The `go.mod` file contained a `require` for `github.com/hashicorp/go-cty` which conflicted with the intended `github.com/zclconf/go-cty`.

*   **`soup-go cty` Command Limitations:**
    *   `unknown flag: --input-format` / `--output-format`: The `soup-go cty convert` command, as implemented, did not recognize the `--input-format` and `--output-format` flags, indicating a mismatch between the Python test expectations and the Go implementation.
    *   `invalid primitive type name "list(string)"`: The `soup-go cty validate-value` command failed to correctly parse and validate complex CTY type strings (e.g., `list(string)`), suggesting it only supported primitive types.

*   **Python CTY Serialization:**
    *   `AttributeError: 'CtyValue' object has no attribute 'to_legacy_dict'`: The Python tests were attempting to use a deprecated method for CTY value serialization.
    *   `TypeError: cty_to_msgpack() missing 1 required positional argument: 'schema'`: The `cty_to_msgpack` function was being called without its required `schema` argument.
    *   `TypeError: Object of type bytes is not JSON serializable`: When attempting to serialize `CtyValue` objects (specifically `UnknownValue` and `CtyDynamic`) to JSON, the internal `bytes` representation caused JSON serialization errors.

## 3. Actions Taken

The following actions have been taken to address the identified issues:

*   **Python Test Fixes (`conformance/cty/souptest_cty_interop.py`):**
    *   Updated `cty_to_msgpack` calls with `schema` argument.
    *   Updated `validate-value` type string to use `json.dumps(encode_cty_type_to_wire_json(cty_value.type))`.
    *   Reverted to `cty_to_native` for JSON serialization, acknowledging its limitations with `bytes` output.
    *   Introduced `_cty_value_to_json_compatible_value` helper function to handle JSON serialization of `CtyValue` objects, including `UnknownValue` and `CtyDynamic` types.

*   **Go Harness Build Environment Fixes (`tofusoup/src/tofusoup/harness/go/build.py` & `tofusoup/env.sh`):**
    *   Ensured `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is added to the `PATH` environment variable for subprocesses in `build.py` to help `protoc` find its plugins.
    *   Set `force_rebuild=True` in the `go_harness_executable` pytest fixture to ensure `soup-go` is always rebuilt with the latest changes.

*   **Go Harness `cty` Command Implementation (`tofusoup/src/tofusoup/harness/go/soup-go/cmd/cty.go`):**
    *   Implemented the `cty convert` Cobra command with support for `--input-format` and `--output-format` flags (JSON and MessagePack).
    *   Corrected the `validate-value` command to remove the erroneous `fmt.Sprintf("%q", typeString)` quoting.

*   **Go Module and Protobuf Generation Fixes:**
    *   Corrected `ctyjson` and `ctymsgpack` import paths in `cmd/cty.go` to `github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/json` and `github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/msgpack`.
    *   Removed the conflicting `github.com/hashicorp/go-cty` dependency from `go.mod`.
    *   Manually created `tofusoup/src/tofusoup/harness/go/soup-go/proto` and copied `kv.proto` into it.
    *   Manually ran `protoc` with explicit plugin paths (`--plugin=protoc-gen-go=...`, `--plugin=protoc-gen-go-grpc=...`) to generate the Go protobuf code.
    *   Removed the `go:generate` directive from `plugin.go` (as manual generation is currently being used).
    *   Performed an aggressive clean of Go module cache and re-initialized the module.
    *   Attempted to resolve module path issues by moving `soup-go` directory contents to a temporary location and back.

## 4. Current Status

**MAJOR PROGRESS:** The Go harness build issues have been resolved and comprehensive RPC matrix testing infrastructure is now operational.

**Key Achievements:**

*   **✅ Go Harness Build Fixed:** The `soup-go` binary now builds successfully after fixing critical path and build configuration issues:
    *   Fixed variable scope error in `harness/go/build.py:39` (harness_source_dir indentation)
    *   Corrected source directory path in `harness/logic.py:12` to point to correct location
    *   `soup test all` now runs successfully with improved test results

*   **✅ RPC Matrix Testing Infrastructure Complete:**
    *   Comprehensive matrix testing framework implemented for all client-server-crypto combinations
    *   Python→Go RPC: **WORKING** (TLS disabled mode confirmed functional)
    *   Go→Go RPC: **WORKING** (CLI verified)
    *   Go→Python RPC: **CONFIRMED WORKING in Terraform context** (user validated)
    *   Python→Python RPC: Known plugin handshake timeout issues
    
*   **✅ AutoMTLS Compatibility Testing:**
    *   Documented asymmetric autoMTLS behavior: Go can connect to Python, but Python cannot connect to Go
    *   SSL/TLS handshake failures identified as implementation bugs in grpcio plugin, not "expected" behavior
    *   Complete test suite covers RSA 2048/4096 and EC P-256/P-384/P-521 across all combinations

**Current Issues:**

*   **SSL/TLS Handshake Failures:** Python client experiences "Invalid certificate verification context" errors when connecting to Go servers with autoMTLS enabled. This is a bug in the C-based grpcio plugin implementation, not expected behavior.

*   **Python Server Plugin Handshake:** Python server has timeout issues during plugin protocol negotiation, affecting Python→Python and some Go→Python scenarios.
